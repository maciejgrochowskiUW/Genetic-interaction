# Genetic-interaction
Based on a growth rate measurement recorded with Bioscreen C (microfermentor that measures optical density of a culture in real time) I can calculate time that is required for given yeast strain to divide.
This will be my numeric value to describe fitness of a given strain.
The theoretical fitness of double mutant is the product of respective single mutants fitnesses.
The difference between the theoretical and recorded fitness is a measure of genetic interaction.
In this script I start off from Bioscreen C results, calculate fitness of every examined strain. Then i calculate value of genetic interactions between studied genes and plot them in similar way to string-db but better.
